        <h2>Trish Adelsperger</h2>
        <h2>"Sister A"</h2>
      
      <p>Howdy ya'll.  Let me introduce myself.  My name is Trish Adelsperger.... but for this class I prefer "Sister A".  I am married to my eternal companion Leo and have 6 wonderful grown children.  I am from California but now we live in El Paso, Texas.  It is usually pretty warm here, but it can be a little cold in the Winter time.</p>
      
      <p> I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for most of my life.  I love the my Heavenly Father, the Lord, and the prophet.  I am thankful that we have been given the greatest gift, the Attonement, our ability to return unto our heavenly home and Father.</p>
      
      <p>Currently, I love being an instructor with BYU Idaho, the Lord's University for "Higher Learning".  I love technology, especially building web sites.  Watching code turn into amazing web pages is very exciting.  Before teaching with BYU, I spent 30 years teaching in the Public School system in California and Texas for grades kindergarden through high school.  I loved having a profound impact on young folks, but really love being able to discuss gospel principles with students here with BYUIdaho best of all.</p>
      
      <p>In my spare time, I love to knit and crochet, sew, bake and cake decorate, and even play a little World of Warcraft with my daughter, son-in-law, and grandkids from time to time on the weekends.</p>
      
        <p> I can be reached by email at: adelspergerp@byui.edu if anyone wants to work with me on any assignments. Two minds are always better than one.  I welcome getting to know all of my wonderful students.  Don't be upset if I refer to you as "Dear", that is what old folks tend to do.  </p>
        
        <p>Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
